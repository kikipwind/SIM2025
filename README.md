#This is my first attempt at an interactive website that acts as a "news" website for a school project. The website should show two columns of information. The left side should show posts from student submitted articles from "The Wire". The right side should show posts from the game controller's article collection called "The Post". There should be a form to submit your article for review to be published. The form should have an input for the title, the author, the body of thearticle, and to tag the post with the following tags: 
International
National
Cyber
Ohio
Space
Terrorism
White House
Pentagon
Military
Intelligence
Congress
Courts
Civil Unrest
Politics
